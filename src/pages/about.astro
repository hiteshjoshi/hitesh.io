            <p>
                Hey there! I'm Hitesh Joshi, a founder and technology enthusiast
                passionate about building things that matter. Currently, I'm the
                CEO and co-founder of <a

                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Ploton</a
                >, where we're revolutionizing how enterprise teams work
                together through intelligent agents and workflow automation.
            </p>

            <p>
                My journey in tech has been a fascinating ride through various
                domains - from deep diving into system architecture to exploring
                the latest in AI and machine learning. At Ploton, we're building
                an agent and workflow builder that helps enterprise teams
                automate repetitive tasks, streamline complex processes, and
                focus on high-value creative work. I believe in the power of AI
                to augment human capabilities, not replace them.
            </p>

            <h2>What I Do</h2>

            <p>
                I wear many hats, but at the core, I'm a builder. Whether it's
                architecting AI-powered systems at Ploton, designing intuitive
                interfaces for complex workflows, or helping teams discover new
                ways to collaborate, I'm always excited about creating tools
                that make a real difference in how people work.
            </p>

            <h2>Why This Blog?</h2>

            <p>
                This blog is my digital garden - a place where I share thoughts,
                learnings, and experiences from my journey. Topics range from
                technical deep-dives and startup insights to philosophical
                musings about technology's role in our lives.
            </p>

            <p>
                I believe in learning in public and sharing knowledge openly.
                Every post here is either something I've learned, something I'm
                exploring, or something I think might help others on their
                journey.
            </p>

            <h2>What We're Building at Ploton</h2>

            <p>
                At Ploton, we're creating a platform where teams can build
                custom AI agents and workflows without needing to code. Our
                mission is to democratize AI automation for enterprise teams,
                making it accessible to everyone from product managers to
                operations teams.
            </p>

            <p>
